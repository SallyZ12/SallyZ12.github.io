In my professional career (in the world of public finance) by necessity I had to figure out a way for the municipal portfolio of insured bonds to be available in ways to monitor the portfolio.  This means I had to be able to extract all insured Bonds from a particular state or geographic region, with a certain credit rating or range of credit ratings, with different sources of repayment.  I worked with the IT department to develop the tools needed so that various analysts had access to this data.  While I did not learn to code, I learned about communicating business requirements, processess, data integrity, internal audit controls, etc.

While helping design front end on-line systems and retrieving data, I always wanted to be able to get to the guts of these processess--learning to code.  Some may say I'm a control freak, but what better level of satisfaction is there in understanding how things work from the front-end to back-end.

This is where my journey begins!
